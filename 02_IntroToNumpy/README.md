## Intro to Numpy

Hosted by: @dotsdl

In this lesson, you will learn:

1. Basic usage of `numpy` arrays for numerical computation, and why they are faster than pure Python.
2. Array arithmetic and broadcasting.
3. Making arrays from scratch for a variety of uses.
3. Selection of elements within arrays using integer indexing, boolean
   indexing, and advanced (fancy) indexing.
   
   
The lesson is live-coded. You can look at the complete lesson in the notebook [Intro_Numpy]({{ site.file }}/02_IntroToNumpy/Solution/Intro_Numpy.ipynb).
