## Tutorial Part 2 - Dealing with distance calculations and trajectories
### Hosted by: @micaela-matta

This part is divided into 2 tutorials, which use the same dataset.
- During the [first part](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopHackathon2018/blob/master/04_Tutorial2/polymer_properties.ipynb), we use simple built-in functions to describe bonds/angles/dihedrals, calculate common polymer descriptors
and learn how to do this over a trajectory.

- During the [second part](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopHackathon2018/blob/master/04_Tutorial2/Hydrogen_bonds.ipynb), we explore the `lib.distances` functions and apply what we learned to find hydrogen bonds in our system.
