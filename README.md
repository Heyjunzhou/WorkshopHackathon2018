# WorkshopHackathon 2018

This repo holds all the materials for the MDAnalysis 2018 Workshop and Hackathon.
Materials are organised according to the Workshop schedule.

See more [details about the workshop](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopHackathon2018/tree/master/00_WorkshopDetails)

## Before the workshop

The workshop will be hands-on. You will need a working installation of
[MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org) and related packages
including data to analyze in order to participate. The full
installation may take up to about 1 GB of space (mostly for data,
which you can delete after the workshop). Because downloading and
installing everything will take a while **you should install
everything before coming to the workshop**.

Follow the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) â€” Windows, macOS, and
Linux are all supported.
