# WorkshopHackathon 2018

This repo holds all the materials for the MDAnalysis 2018 Workshop and Hackathon.
Materials are organised according to the Workshop schedule.

<!-- See more [details about the workshop](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopHackathon2018/tree/master/00_WorkshopDetails) -->

## Before the workshop

The workshop will be hands-on. You will need a working installation of
[MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org) and related packages
including data to analyze in order to participate. The full
installation may take up to about 1 GB of space (mostly for data,
which you can delete after the workshop). Because downloading and
installing everything will take a while **you should install
everything before coming to the workshop**.

Follow the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) — Windows, macOS, and
Linux are all supported.

## Time and Location

The workshop takes place on Nov 12 and Nov 13, 2016 at Northwestern
University, 2nd floor of [Mudd
Library](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/libraries-collections/mudd-library/index.html),
2233 Tech Drive, Evanston, IL 60208, in the
[classroom](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/visit/maps/mudd-library/index.html).
