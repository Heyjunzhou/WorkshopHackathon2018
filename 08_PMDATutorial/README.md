## PMDA tutorial
Hosted by: @VOD555

[PMDA](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pmda/) (parallel MDAnalysis) provides ready-to-use analysis and buildings blocks to write parallel analysis algorithms using MDAnalysis with [Dask](https://dask.org/), which we introduced in our [Dask Tutorial](../07_DaskTutorial/).

During this interactive lesson, students should work on the _student notebook_ [PMDA_student_notebook.ipynb]({{ site.file }}/08_PMDATutorial/PMDA_student_notebook.ipynb) and also download the [bsites.py]({{ site.file }}/08_PMDATutorial/bsites.py) file.

The complete solution is available as the [PMDA_tutorial]({{ site.file }}/08_PMDATutorial/PMDA_tutorial.ipynb) notebook.
